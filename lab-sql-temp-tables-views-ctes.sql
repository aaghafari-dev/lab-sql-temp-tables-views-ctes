#    Step 1: Create a View
# First, create a view that summarizes rental information for each customer. The view should include the customer's ID, name, email address, and total number of rentals (rental_count).
	DROP VIEW IF EXISTS customer_rental_summary;

    CREATE VIEW customer_rental_summary AS
	SELECT
		c.customer_id,
		CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
		c.email,
		COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
	FROM customer c
	LEFT JOIN rental r
		ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
	GROUP BY
		c.customer_id,
		c.first_name,
		c.last_name,
		c.email;
# query the view:
	SELECT * FROM customer_rental_summary
	LIMIT 10;
       
# Step 2: Create a Temporary Table
		#Next, create a Temporary Table that calculates the total amount paid by each customer (total_paid). The Temporary Table should use the rental summary view created in Step 1 to join with the payment table and calculate the total amount paid by each customer.        
		CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_payment_summary AS
		SELECT
			crs.customer_id,
			SUM(p.amount) AS total_paid
		FROM customer_rental_summary crs
		LEFT JOIN payment p
			ON crs.customer_id = p.customer_id
		GROUP BY crs.customer_id;
  
		SHOW TABLES;
        SELECT * FROM customer_payment_summary
		LIMIT 10;

# Step 3: Create a CTE and the Customer Summary Report
	#Create a CTE that joins the rental summary View with the customer payment summary Temporary Table created in Step 2. The CTE should include the customer's name, email address, rental count, and total amount paid.
	# Next, using the CTE, create the query to generate the final customer summary report, which should include: customer name, email, rental_count, total_paid and average_payment_per_rental, this last column is a derived column from total_paid and rental_count.	
    
	WITH customer_summary_cte AS (
		SELECT
			crs.customer_name,
			crs.email,
			crs.rental_count,
			cps.total_paid
		FROM customer_rental_summary crs
		LEFT JOIN customer_payment_summary cps
			ON crs.customer_id = cps.customer_id
	)
	SELECT
		customer_name,
		email,
		rental_count,
		total_paid,
		CASE
			WHEN rental_count > 0 THEN total_paid / rental_count
			ELSE 0
		END AS average_payment_per_rental
	FROM customer_summary_cte;
